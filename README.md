# Flo App (Flutter)

A starter Flutter application scaffold for the Flo project.

## Goals
- Quick to run skeleton Flutter app
- Riverpod for state management
- Named routes and basic auth flow stub
- Tests and linting ready to expand

## Setup

1. Install Flutter: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
2. Get dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. Run the app (on an emulator or device):

```bash
flutter run
```

## Project structure
- `lib/main.dart` - App entry point
- `lib/src/app.dart` - App widget and router
- `lib/src/screens/` - Screens (Home, Login, Profile)
- `lib/src/widgets/` - Shared widgets
- `test/` - Widget tests

## Next steps
- Add Firebase (optional) or a backend API
- Add CI for tests (GitHub Actions or similar)
- Add real authentication flow
